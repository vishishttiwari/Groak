// See why any of the textview is not working. Make a different common extension for textview
// Any new stuff will be added to order view controller
// Add a back button to BottomSheetView
// See when you come back from MenuViewController, how to make the list appear again
// Add times to orderviewcontroller'
// The special instructions is not working so look into that
// Use dimensions rather than contraints in Special Requests
// See if cell dynamically change size if image etc. is not present
// Loading indicator for view controllers
// Loading indicator for images
// Get the user out either after distance or after time 3 hours maybe
// Notifications
// Start with camera and also have, not your restaurant and then show table
// Detach firestore listeners
// Add screens for when location or camera is not activated
// Save your order locally in cache (permanent)
// When ready to pay add it to the server


// Screen for when location or camera not added
// Times in order
// Instructions in order
// Notifications

// Loading indicator for cell
// See if cells change size dynamically
// get the user out of restaurant when location changes and after 3 hours
// Detach listeners
// Vegetarian icons etc.

// Have temporary graphics
// Different graphics for different loading
